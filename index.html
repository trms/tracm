<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Tracm is a client for the ACM Shared Content Server and other content sharing sites.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Use the settings tab to enter your credentials for the ACM Shared Content Server and select a download folder.  After adding videos to your download queue, click the download tab and click "Refresh SCS Queue" to download the video files to your download folder.  That's it!
</p>

<p>
You can use the Upload tab to enter metadata and queue a video file to be uploaded under your account to the Shared Content Server.
</p>

<p>
If you have a Cablecast server*, you can enter the settings for it on the Settings tab and tracm will automatically fetch the metadata from Cablecast for files you're uploading.  Furthermore, tracm will create a show record in Cablecast after downloading any video files as well.
</p>

<p>
* Cablecast integration requires Cablecast 4.9
